# FruitsAngular

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.1.0.
I created a simple front side application and implemented only get requests. 
when launching, the app will send a http GET request (a service injected in the component constructor and calling httpget function).
the defalt screen will show some details about the data in the database and there is an option to choose whether you want to see this datta for all objects or only for apples(as you requested).

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
